Description: Provides an interpretable identification of subgroups with 
    heterogeneous causal effect. The heterogeneous subgroups are discovered 
    through ensemble learning of causal rules. Causal rules are highly 
    interpretable if-then statement that recursively partition the features 
    space into heterogeneous subgroups. A small number of significant causal 
    rules are selected through Stability Selection to control for family-wise 
    error rate in the finite sample setting. It proposes various estimation 
    methods for the conditional causal effects for each discovered causal rule. 
    It is highly flexible and multiple causal estimands and imputation methods 
    are implemented.
